It's great to hear from you!

I heard that SIC Systems let you go immediately after you demoed your (incomplete) self-hosting program. Ilano is going to be kicking himself when he realizes that the implementation SIC Systems owns doesn't support self-modifying code!

Now that you're solely in possession of the only *truly* self-hosting program for the SIC-1, my advice is: destroy it. Erase all copies, set them on fire, and bury the ashes out in the desert. Ilano doesn't deserve to ever take advantage of your work again.

Speaking of work, I wanted to let you know that I found a job at a small startup that is working on a home computer with a graphical interface. It's revolutionary stuff, and we need someone with your technical skills to go to market.

Is there any chance you'd be open to discussing a lead engineering position over here?

If you're interested, let me know and I'll schedule a meeting with us and the two remaining founders (both named Steve, by coincidence).

Hope to hear from you soon!

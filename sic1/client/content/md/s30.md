Truly amazing work, {{self.name}}!

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for all of the sacrifices you've made to get us to this point. The SIC-1 is now able to reason about its own code. This is an amazing breakthrough and you should be very proud.

Now that we've reached this exciting milestone (thanks to your tireless efforts!), SIC Systems honestly can't challenge someone with your peerless talent. Excitingly, you can now begin the next phase of your career at one of the many other technology companies around the world. I know parting ways is tough, but SIC Systems is a business, not a family, so we have to say goodbye to employees once they're no longer needed. Thank you one last time, and best of luck in your future endeavors!
